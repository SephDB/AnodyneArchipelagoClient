# Extended Swap
After defeating the Briar in the base game, the Broom's Swap upgrade is fully unlocked, allowing you to use the ability almost everywhere in the game. This gives you access to several postgame items and areas that are otherwise unreachable. However, it also breaks through almost every progression barrier in the game, which destroys Archipelago's logic.

To remedy this, the fully unlocked Swap ability never becomes available in the modded game. Instead, an "Extended Swap" can be unlocked, depending on what your postgame mode is. If it is set to Vanilla, this unlocks once you defeat Briar (as long as you have the Swap item, of course). If it is set to Unlocked, Extended Swap immediately becomes available upon receiving the Swap item. If it is set to Progressive, the first Progressive Swap you receive gives you the limited Swap from the base game (in which it is only usable in the single post-boss rooms in Hotel, Apartment, and Circus, as well as the GO color puzzle), and the second Progressive Swap you receive unlocks Extended Swap.

Extended Swap expands the swappable areas to include terrain near postgame content. This allows you to use Swap to access these areas, without completely destroying logic. These areas are not indicated clearly in-game, but you can use this file to see where they are.
